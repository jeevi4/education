  <div class="grid1">
    <h4>Absolute Brightness (Absolute Magnitude)</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="grid2">
    <p>A measure of the true brightness of an object. The absolute brightness or magnitude of an object is the apparent brightness or magnitude it would have if it were located exactly 32.6 light-years (10 parsecs) away. For example, the apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear
       much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Absolute Zero</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>The coldest possible temperature, at which all molecular motion stops. On the Kelvin temperature scale, this temperature 
    is the zero-point (0 K), which is equivalent to -273°C and -460°F.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Absorption</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>The process by which light transfers its energy to matter. For example, a gas cloud can absorb starlight that passes through it. After the starlight passes through the cloud, dark lines called absorption lines appear in the star’s continuous 
    spectrum at wavelengths corresponding to the light-absorbing elements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Absorption Line</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A dark line in a continuous spectrum caused by absorption of light. Each chemical element emits and absorbs radiated energy at specific wavelengths, making it possible to identify the elements present in the atmosphere of a star 
    or other celestial body by analyzing which absorption lines are present.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Accelerating Universe</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A model for the universe in which a repulsive force counteracts
     the attractive force of gravity, driving all the matter in the universe apart at speeds that increase with time. Recent observations of distant supernova explosions suggest that we may live in an accelerating universe.

  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Accretion</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>In astronomy, accretion is the process of growing a massive object by
     gravitationally attracting less massive objects. Many objects, such as stars and black holes, grow by pulling gas and rocks from a gravitationally bound accretion disk.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Accretion Disk</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A relatively flat, rapidly rotating disk of gas surrounding a black hole, a newborn star, or any massive object that attracts and swallows matter. Accretion disks around stars are expected to contain dust particles and may show evidence of active
     planet formation. Beta Pictoris is an example of a star known to have an accretion disk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>An optical camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope that uses CCD detectors to make images. The camera covers twice the area, has twice the sharpness, and is up to 10 times more efficient than the telescopes Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. The ACS wavelength range spans from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. The cameras sharp eye and broader viewing area allow astronomers to study the life cycles of galaxies in the remotest regions of the universe. Astronauts installed the camera aboard the telescope in March 2002, but the camera experienced an electrical short in 2007 that shut down all but one data channel. During Servicing Mission 4 in 2009, astronauts replaced the 
    failed circuit boards and added a new power supply box to restore power to the camera</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Alpha Process</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A process by which lighter elements capture helium nuclei (alpha particles) to form heavier elements. For example, when a carbon nucleus captures an alpha particle, a heavier oxygen nucleus is formed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Ammonia (ice)</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>This is a molecule composed of one nitrogen and three hydrogen atoms. It is an abundant molecule in the universe and can be found in either gaseous or
     solid phase (as ice) in the vacuum of space, depending on the temperature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Angular Momentum</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A property that an object, such as a planet revolving around the Sun, possesses
     by virtue of its rotation or circular motion. An object’s angular momentum cannot change unless some force acts to speed up or slow down its circular motion. This principle, known as conservation of angular momentum, is why an object can indefinitely maintain a circular motion around an axis of revolution or rotation.
  </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Angstrom (Å)</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A unit of length equal to one ten-billionth of one meter (0.0000000001, or 10-10 meters). 
    An angstrom is equal to one tenth of one nanometer.   </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Apparent Brightness (Apparent Magnitude)</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A measure of the brightness of a celestial object as it appears from Earth. The Sun is the brightest object in Earth’s sky and has the greatest apparent magnitude, with the moon second. Apparent brightness
     does not take into account how far away the object is from Earth</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Arc Minute</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>One arc minute is 1/60 of a degree of arc. The angular diameter 
    of the full moon or the Sun as seen from Earth is about 30 arc minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Asteroid</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>A small solar system object composed mostly of rock. Many of these objects orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Their sizes range anywhere from 33 feet (10 meters) in diameter to less than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers).
     The largest known asteroid, Ceres, has a diameter of 579 miles (926 kilometers).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Astronomer</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>
    A scientist who studies the universe and the celestial bodies residing in it, including their composition, history, location, and motion. Many of the scientists at the Space Telescope Science Institute are astronomers.
     Astronomers from all over the world use the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="grid1">
  <h4>Axis</h4>
</div>
<div class="grid2">
  <p>An imaginary line through the center of an object.
     The object rotates around this line.</p>
